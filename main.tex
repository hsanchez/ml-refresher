\section{General matters}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is Machine Learning?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \say{\textit{Machine Learning (or \textbf{ML}) is fitting a function to
    examples\footnote{An example, or a sample, is a data point that belongs
    to some data} and using that function to generalize and make predictions
    about new examples.}}\\\hspace{25em}\textit{Derek Jedamski, GitHub}
    \item Machine Learning, by large, falls into three categories:\vspace{.4em}
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item[-] Supervised learning
      \item[-] Unsupervised learning
      \item[-] Reinforcement learning
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item And solves two types of problems: Classification and Regression.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is Supervised Learning?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item In \textbf{Supervised Learning} (or \textbf{SL}), you are given a
    bunch of examples and their labels (e.g., A or B) and the goal is to
    classify, when you are given a new example, to which label we
    should assign the new example.
    \item \textcolor{blue}{You could think of these labels as the names of the
    \textbf{classes or clusters} to which certain portions of the data belong.}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you give an example of Supervised Learning?}}
  \vspace{.4em}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Support vector machines} or \textbf{SVM}},
    is a ML algorithm that takes some data as input and returns as output
    an optimal separating \textit{hyperplane} between pieces of data; e.g., a plane separating A from B.
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item[-] In this example, A and B sit in some high dimensional space, and the idea is to
      construct a plane that maximizes the margins\footnote{distance between points closest
      to the line and the actual line} between the plane and the data.
      \item[-] If a new datum sits closer to one area of the data, say A, then
      we assign this new datum to A.
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item (For historical reasons) This algorithm is called \textbf{support
    vector machines} because the vectors that lie on the margin of the plane are
    called the \textit{support} vectors.
  \end{wideitemize}

  \begin{framed}
  This is a method for constructing a device to discriminate. If we're having
  a supervised learning problem then this method gives me an optimal form of
  discrimination.
  \end{framed}

\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item This algorithm has an exponential speed up when you do it quantum mechanically..
}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What more can you say about SVM?}}
  \vspace{.4em}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{SVM} works on both linearly and non-linearly separable data. In latter case, it use
    the kernel trick\footnote{adds one more dimension and call it $z$-axis -- governed by the
    constraint $z = x^2 + y^2$ and $z$ is the squared distance of the points from origin.} to convert
    these data to linearly separable data in a higher dimension. This transformation is called kernel.
    \item A hyperplane in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is a flat, $n-1$ dimensional subset of that
    space that divides the space into two disconnected parts.
  \end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Tuning SVM Hyper-parameters?}}
  \vspace{.4em}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter and hyper-parameter tuning:}
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item \textbf{Kernel:} The main function of the kernel\footnote{Kernels can lead to more accurate classifiers.}
      is to transform the given dataset input data into the required form. There are various types of
      functions such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF). Polynomial and RBF are
      useful for non-linear hyperplane.
      \item \textbf{Regularization:} $C$ is regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between smooth decision
      boundary\footnote{a decision boundary or decision surface is a hyper-surface that partitions
      the underlying vector space into two sets, one for each class.} and classifying training
      points correctly. A large $C$ means you'll get more training points correctly.
      \item \textbf{Gamma}: Gamma defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches.
      A large gamma means the decision boundary is just going to be dependent upon the points that
      are very close to the line.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Advantages and Disadvantages SVM?}}
  \vspace{.4em}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages}
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item SVM Classifiers offer \textbf{good accuracy and perform faster prediction}
      compared to Naive Bayes algorithm. They also use less memory because they
      use a subset of training points in the decision phase. SVM works well with
      a clear margin of separation and with high dimensional space.
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{Disadvantages}
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item SVM is \textbf{not suitable for large datasets} because of its high training
      time and it also takes more time in training compared to Naive Bayes. It
      \textbf{works poorly with overlapping classes} and is also \textbf{sensitive} to the type
      of \textbf{kernel} used.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is Unsupervised Learning?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item In \textbf{Unsupervised Learning} (or \textbf{UL}), you are given a
    bunch of data and you are not told they fall naturally into clusters, and
    also you are not told what these clusters are.
    \item \textcolor{blue}{The goal is identify the clusters within data, how
    many clusters there are, and then be able to assign new things to
    these different clusters.}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you give an example of Unsupervised Learning?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Principal Component Analysis (or \textbf{PCA})} is a classical UL algorithm.
    \item In \textbf{PCA}, the way this works, we construct a \textit{covariance matrix},
    and my covariance matrix is just the following object: $C = \sum_{j} \vec{v}_j\vec{v}^{\dagger}_{j}$,
    where $\vec{v}^{T}_{j}$ is the transpose of $\vec{v}_{j}$.
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item[-] In other words, we construct $C$ from the data by taking these vectors $\vec{v}_j$ and
      multiply them by their transpose $\vec{v}^{\dagger}_j$.
      %\item E.g., Financial forecasting: the vectors could be, for example, can
      %represent the changes in stock prices over a 24 hr period, and the
      %covariance matrix $C$ would give the correlations (or covariances in the
      %data) between the prices of the different stocks in different times within
      %the 24 hrs period.
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item In \textbf{PCA}, you diagonalize $C$ and say $C = \sum_{k} P_k
	  \vec{\omega}_{k}\vec{\omega}^{\dagger}_{k}$\footnote{C can be decomposed into a product
    of matrices involving eigenvalues and eigenvectors}, $P_k$ is piece of the data with size $k$,
    and $\vec{\omega}_{k}$ are the set of vectors you need to find.
    \item If and only if a small set of $P_k >> 0$, then $C$ is effectively low-rank,
    and the corresponding $\vec{\omega}_{k}$ are the principal components. In other words,
    you need find the eigenvectors that have the largest eigenvalues -- i.e., your principal components.
  \end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What else can you say about PCA?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item In general terms, this PCA process is about finding the underlying
    patterns of the data and also gives you a method for data compression.\medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item If you want to \textit{approximate}\footnote{All your vectors can be written as the sum of a few $w$s.} the whole matrix with few vectors, the best vectors to choose are top PCA vectors (the principal components).
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item PCA is all about diagonalizing the covariance matrix.
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item PCA is an exercise in linear algebra on very high dimensional vector spaces.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item SVD vs PCA: SVD allows us to extract and untangle information, decompose a
matrix into several component matrices (factorization), meaning it exposes many
of the useful and interesting properties of the original matrix.  PCA can be
computed form SVD but that will be much more expensive.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. When to use PCA?}}
  \vspace{.4em}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{When to use it}
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item PCA should be used if one to figure out if there are latent features
      driving the patterns in the data. E.g., The big shots at SRI International.
      \item Dimensionality reduction (and feature selection). E.g., helps you
      visualize high dimensional data, helps you reduce noise in your data, make
      other ML algos work better (regression, classification) because fewer inputs.
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{When not to use it}
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item PCA is not suitable in many cases: For example, if all the components of PCA
      have quite a high variance, there is no \textit{good} universal stopping rule that
      allows you to discard some exact \textit{k} Principal Components, meaning no good
      data compression.
      \item Not good when working with fine-grained classes\footnote{hard-to-distinguish object classes}.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

%   \begin{wideitemize}
%     \item \textbf{Advantages}
%     \begin{wideitemize}
%       \item Dimensionality reduction
%       \item Allows estimation of probabilities in high-dimensional data.
%       \item It renders a set of components that are uncorrelated (latent features).
%     \end{wideitemize}
%     \item \textbf{Disadvantages}
%     \begin{wideitemize}
%       \item It has a high computational cost, meaning it'll struggle with very large datasets.
%       \item Non-linear structure is hard to model with PCA.
%     \end{wideitemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is Reinforcement Learning?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside
    supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
    \item In reinforcement learning an algorithm learns to do something by being
    rewarded for successful behavior and/or being punished for unsuccessful behavior.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item In a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on a labeled
dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its
accuracy on training data.
\item An unsupervised model, in contrast, provides unlabeled data that the
algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you give an example of Reinforcement Learning?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Policy Gradient (PG)
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item In this method, we have the policy $\pi$ that has a parameter $\theta$. This $\pi$
      outputs a probability distribution of actions.
      \item Then we must find the best parameters ($\theta$) to maximize (optimize) a score
      function $J(\theta)$, given the discount factor $\gamma$ and the reward $r.$
      \item Main steps:\medskip
      \begin{wideitemize}
        \item Measure the quality of a policy with the policy score function
        \item Use policy gradient ascent to find the best param that improves the policy.
      \end{wideitemize}

    \Huge Examples of Classification and Regression problems
  \end{center}
\end{transitionsubframe}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you give an example of a Classification Problem?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item E.g., trying to write a machine learning program that will be able to detect cancerous
    tumors in lungs. It takes in images of lung x-rays as input and determines if there is a tumor.
    If there is a tumor, we'd like the computer to output ``yes'' and if there is not a tumor, we'd
    like the computer to output ``no.'' We’d like the computer to output the correct answer as much as possible.
    \item Say the training set for this algorithm consists of several images of x-rays, half of the images
    contain tumors and are labelled ``yes'' and the other half do not contain tumors and are labelled ``no.''
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you give an example of a Regression Problem?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item In regression problem the goal of the algorithm is to predict real-valued output.
    \item E.g., Let’s consider the problem of predicting the marks of a student based on the number of hours he/she
    put for the preparation.
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item Assume for the sake of understanding that the marks of a student (M) do depend on the number of hours (H) he/she put up for preparation.
      \item The following formula can represent the model: $M = m*H + c$
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Classification vs Regression?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Classification is the task of predicting a discrete class label.
    \item Regression is the task of predicting a continuous quantity.
    \item There's some overlap between classification and regression algorithms; for example
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item A classification algorithm may predict a continuous value, but the continuous value is in the form of a probability for a class label.
      \item A regression algorithm may predict a discrete value, but the discrete value in the form of an integer quantity.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Data representation}
\begin{transitionsubframe}
  \begin{center}
    \Huge Data representation
  \end{center}
\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. How do you represent data in ML?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item In general, the given data is expressed in a form of a bunch of vectors
    $\vec{v}_{j} \in {\Bbb R}^{d}$ that belong to some high dimensional vector space.
    \item For instance, in image recognition, the vector\footnote{a.k.a., feature
    vector; it could be numerical (e.g., height of tree) or descriptive
    (e.g., eye color)} of an each image is a set of pixels\footnote{each entry
    in the vector (e.g., pixel) represents a feature.} (i.e., a pixelated
    version of the image).
    \item If you have a notion of distance $\Delta(\vec{v}_{i}, \vec{v}_{j})$,
    then you can compare which vectors are close to each other in this high
    dimensional vector space; e.g., the norm $\norm{\vec{v}_{i} - \vec{v}_{j}}^2$.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile, label={distance}]{\textbf{Q. What is it important about measuring distances?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Because the shorter the distance between two feature vectors the closer
    in character are the two samples they represent.
    \item There are many ways to measure distance:
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item[-] \textbf{Manhattan distance} ($L^{1}$ norm). The sum of the absolute values of the different between
      entries in the vector. (Preferred dist. when dealing with high dimensional data.)
      \item[-] \textbf{Euclidean distance} ($L^{2}$ norm). Square the distances between vector entries,
      sum these and square root.
      \item[-] \textbf{Cosine similarity}. Cosine of the angle between two vectors\footnote{Two vectors
      might be similar if they are pointing in the same direction even if they are of different lengths.}.
      Just take the \textit{dot} product of two vectors and divide by the two lengths.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile, label={CoD}]{\textbf{Q. Any other issues we should care to learn?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item The curse of dimensionality. This phenomena involves data in high dimensions.
    \item Suppose you are working in $M$ dimensions, that is you data has $M$
    features. And suppose you have $N$ data points. Having a large number of
    data points is good, the more the merrier. BUT what about number of features?
    \item Think how these $N$ data points might be distributed over $M$ dimensions.
    Suppose that the numerical data for each feature is $0$ or $1$. Therefore, there
    will be $2^{M}$ possible combinations.\medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item If $N$ is less than $2^{M}$ then you run the risk of having every data
      point being on a different corner of the $M$-dimensional hypercube.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

  \end{center}
\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What does this process looks like?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{Explore and clean the data}. Explore the data to really understand
    what those features look like, then we use some of these learnings to clean the data.
    \item \textbf{Split data into train/validation/test data sets}.
    \item \textbf{Fit an initial model (baseline) and evaluate using 5-fold cross-validation}.
    % We will use 5-fold cross
    % validation o the training set to fit an initial model to see what we can expect
    % for the baseline performance of the model.
    \item \textbf{Tune hyper-parameters using GridSearchCV} to find the best models\footnote{those models that beat our baseline}.
    \item \textbf{Evaluate best models on validation set} and select the top model of each
    algorithm, and we evaluate them against each other on the validation set.
    \item \textbf{Select and evaluate the final model on the test set}. We'll evaluate top
    model on the test set to get an unbiased view of the model performance on completely unseen data.
  \end{wideitemize}

    \Huge Measuring success
  \end{center}
\end{transitionframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile, label={distance}]{\textbf{Q. What does it mean to measure success of the model?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item So the question is how do we make sure the model is learning the underlying pattern
    and not just memorizing the examples?
    \item We can do this by splitting our data into three data sets: the training, validation,
    and testing data sets.\medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      % \item[-] This part is about the model needing to learn the underlying pattern
      % (or correlation) that will allow it to make predictions about future examples.
      % The first step is walking through why it's necessary to split up our data before
      % we build a model. Please recall the definition of ML that we settled on back in the first
      % section of these slides. Particularly, recall the part on generalizing to make predictions
      % about new examples. This part is about the model needing to learn the underlying pattern
      % (or correlation) that will allow it to make predictions about future examples.
      \item This part is about making sure the model is learn the underlying pattern
      (or correlation) and able to make predictions about future examples.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item Now that we have a decent idea of how to explore and clean our data, we want to start
setting the stage for building a model by understanding what it means to measure success of
the model.
}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. But why do we split the data?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{Ans.} We do it to make sure\footnote{We don't know how well the model will generalize
    because we don't have any additional data to test this.} our model is learning
    the underlying pattern and not just memorizing the examples.
    \item We do that by splitting our dataset into three separate segments;
    training (60\%), validation (20\%), and testing (20\%) data sets.\medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item \textbf{Training data}, or examples that the model will learn
      those general patterns from.
      \item \textbf{Validation data}, or examples we use to select the best model (optimal algorithm
      and hyper-parameter settings).
      \item \textbf{Test data}, or examples we use to provide an unbiased evaluation of what
      the model will look like in its real environment.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Why does the evaluation process look like with these datasets?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item[1.] You start train your ML algorithm on the training data, evaluate it
    using the validation data, then at this point:\medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item If none of your models are any good based on the performance on the
      validation set, then you need to revisit the training phase and consider
      some new variables or new models. (Go back to step 1.)
      \item If the performance is quite good, then you can select your best model
      and pass it onto the testing phase. (Go to step 2.)
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item[2.] You evaluate the best model on the test set.\medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item If the performance is what you expect, then that model is ready to go.
      Otherwise go to step to the drawing board.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is cross-validation? Holdout test set?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{Holdout test set:} A generalization of the test set. It's just any data set
    that was not used in fitting a model (data set aside for evaluating the model's ability to generalize).
    \item \textbf{K-Fold Cross-Validation:} Data is divided into $k$ subsets and the holdout method
    is repeated $k$ times. Each time, one of the $k$ subsets is used as the test set and the other
    $k - 1$ subsets are combined to be used to train the model.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item The previous process how to use training, validation and test set to measure
our model's ability to generalize.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. 5-Fold Cross-Validation Example?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item E.g., $5$-fold CV: Given $10,000$ examples, you partition into $5$ buckets, each consisting
    of $2,000$ examples\footnote{this is partitioning is done thru sampling without replacement; no
    single example will appear in two different subsets and all original $10,000$ are still
    accounted for in these subsets}.
    \item \textbf{On trial} $1$, we set aside the last bucket (holdout test set) and the other $4$ buckets are the
    training set, then compute its predictive performance. On \textbf{trial} $2$, we set aside the penultimate
    bucket, and the other $4$ buckets are the training set. This will be similar for the other $3$ \textbf{trials}.
    \item At the end we \textit{average} the performance of model over the many trails.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Establishing our Evaluation framework?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item A cohesive framework for evaluating our model, consisting of two components:\medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item \textbf{Evaluation metrics}: how are gauging the accuracy of the model?
      \item \textbf{Process (how to split the data)}: how do we leverage a given
      data set to mitigate the likelihood of overfitting and underfitting.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Evaluation metrics}
\begin{transitionsubframe}
  \begin{center}
    \Huge Evaluation metrics:\\\textbf{There isn't a one-size-fits-all metric.}
  \end{center}
\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What are the evaluation metrics that we'll use?}}
\begin{wideitemize}
  \item The metric(s) chosen to evaluate a ML model depends on various factors:\medskip
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Is it a regression or a classification task? E.g., MSE vs Accuracy.
    \item What is the business objective? E.g., precision vs recall.
    \item What is the distribution of the target variable?
  \end{wideitemize}
  \item Examples of other metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error
    (MSE), R-squared, Confusion Matrix and related metrics (Precision, Recall, Accuracy).
\end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item Regression: Mean Squared Percentage Error (MSPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Minimum Sum of Absolute Error (MSAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, Adjusted R-squared
\item Classification: Confusion Matrix and related metrics (Precision, Recall, Accuracy),
Receiver Operating Characteristics \& Area under the curve (ROC-AUC), log-loss, F1-score
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Metrics for classification problem?}}
\begin{wideitemize}
  \item We're going to use 3 commonly used evaluation metrics:\medskip
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Accuracy: $\frac{\# \text{predicted correctly}}{\text{total } \# \text{ of examples}}$
    \item Precision:
    $\frac{\# \text{ predicted as class A that was actually class A}}{\text{total } \# \text{ predicted to be in class A}}$
    \item Recall:
    $\frac{\# \text{ predicted as class A that was actually class A}}{\text{total } \# \text{ that were actually in class A}}$
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you explain what precision and recall are?}}
\begin{wideitemize}
  \item \textbf{Recall} is a measure of completeness or quantity, whereas
   \item \textbf{Precision} is a measure of exactness or quality:\vspace{.4em}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \parbox[t]{1.5in}{$\underbrace{Recall = \frac{TP}{TP +
            FN}}_{\substack{\text{What proportion of actual positives}\\ \text{was identified correctly?}}}$} \hspace{.6in}
      \parbox[t]{1.5in}{$\underbrace{Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}}_{\substack{\text{What
            proportion of positive identifications}\\\text{was actually correct?}}}$}
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{High precision} means your algorithm has returned
  substantially \textit{more relevant results than irrelevant ones}, while
  \textbf{high recall} means your algorithm has returned \textit{most of the
  relevant results}.
\end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is a confusion matrix?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item A \textbf{Confusion Matrix} is a simple way of understanding \textbf{how well an
    algorithm is doing at classifying data}. It is just the idea of \textbf{false
      positives} and \textbf{false negatives}
  \item
    \begin{tabular}{cc|cc}
      \multicolumn{1}{c}{} &\multicolumn{1}{c}{} &\multicolumn{2}{c}{Predicted} \\
      \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Yes} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{No} \\ \hline
      \multirow[c]{2}{*}{\rotatebox[origin=tr]{90}{Actual}} & Yes & TP & FN \\[1.5ex] & No & FP & TN \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you explain what are false positives and false negatives?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item There are two errors that often rear their head when you are learning
    about hypothesis testing —- \textbf{false positives} and \textbf{false negatives}, technically
    referred to as type I error and type II error respectively.
  \item \textbf{False positives} are incorrect classifications of the presence
    of a condition when it is actually absent. A \textbf{false positive} is \textcolor{red}{when you
      reject a true null hypothesis}.
  \item \textbf{False negatives} are incorrect classifications of the absence of
    a condition when it is actually present. A \textbf{false negative} is \textcolor{red}{when you accept
      a false null hypothesis}.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Provide examples when false positives are more
      important than false negatives, false negatives are more important than
      false positives and when these two types of errors are equally important}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Case 1, \textbf{Airport security}. Ensuring that truly dangerous items like
    weapons cannot be brought on board an aircraft. Getting false positives is better than
    getting false negatives: missing cases of actual weapons could lead to dangerous situations.
  \item Case 2, \textbf{cancer screening}. Even though false-positive results could create
  anxiety and lead to unnecessary and invasive follow-up tests like biopsies, missing cases of
  actual cancer could lead to delays in treatment that negatively affect somebody's life.
  \item Case 3, \textbf{forecasting} (health weather). Measuring success of testing cases
  of covid-19 in the US. Tracking rate of false positives and false negatives seems to make sense.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you list some of metrics derived from Confusion Matrix?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item Confusion matrix related metrics
    \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Accuracy rate: {\footnotesize $\frac{TP + TN}{Total}$}
      where {\footnotesize Total is $TP + TN + FP + FN$},\vspace{-.5em}
    \item Error rate: {\footnotesize $1 - \frac{TP + TN}{Total}$},\vspace{-.5em}
    \item False positive rate\footnote{It's a measure of accuracy for a test}:
    {\footnotesize $\frac{FP}{TN + FP}$},\vspace{-.5em}
    \item False negative rate\footnote{It's proportion of the individuals with a known
    positive condition for which the test result is negative}:
    {\footnotesize $\frac{FN}{TP + FN}$},\vspace{-.5em}
    \item Recall: {\footnotesize $\frac{TP}{TP + TN}$}, Precision: {\footnotesize $\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$},\vspace{-.5em}
    \item Specificity: {\footnotesize $1 - \frac{FP}{TN + FP}$},\vspace{-.5em}
    \item Prevalence: {\footnotesize $\frac{TP + FN}{Total}$}
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. How do you measure how  good your
      classification algorithm is? You have unbalanced numbers, with our class
      being much larger or smaller than others}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item You use the Matthews correlation coefficient. The number it yields is
    between plus or minus one. Plus one means perfect prediction, zero means no
    better than random.
  \item $\frac{\text{TP x TN - FP x FN}}{\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}}$
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Is there another way to measure how well an
      algorithm is classifying data? Also given an example}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item Another way of looking at how well an algorithm is classifying is the
    \textbf{receiver operating characteristic} or \textbf{ROC} curve.
    \item E.g., suppose there is a threshold (or parameter) in your
      classification algorithm that determines whether you have an apple or a
      non apple object.
      \begin{wideitemize}
      \item[-] Plot the \textit{true positive} rate against the
        \textit{false positive} rate as the threshold (or parameter) varies.
        Points above the $45\degree$ diagonal are good, and the further
        into the top left of the plot the better.
      \item[-] The area under the ROC curve (the \textbf{AUC}\footnote{AUC is
          used to rank kaggle competitions}) is then a measure of how
        good different algorithms are. The closer to one (the max possible) the better.

\subsection{Evaluation Process}

  \end{center}
\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Process description?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item Run fivefold cross-validation and select the best models.
  \item Re-fit models on full training set, evaluate them on the validation set, pick the best one.
  \item Evaluate best model on the test set to gauge its ability
  to generalize to unseen data.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Unpacking terms}
\begin{transitionsubframe}
  \begin{center}
    \Huge \textbf{What do we mean by training, best fit, performance? Any risks?}
  \end{center}
\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. But, what is training in ML anyway?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Most ML algorithms need to be trained. That is, you give
    them data and they look for patterns, or best fits, etc.
    \item They know they are doing well when perhaps a loss function
    has been minimized, or the rewards have been maximized.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Best fits? What do you mean by best fits? Performance?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item First of all, when we say ``fitting'' in ML we are talking about model fitting.
    \item Model fitting is a measure of how well a machine learning model
    generalizes\footnote{Yes, we are talking about ML model performance.} to similar data
    on which it was \textit{trained}.
    \item A model that is well-fitted produces more accurate outcomes\footnote{An overfitted model
    matches the data too closely. An underfitted model doesn't match closely enough.}.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. How do you measure the performance of a ML model?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item We do that by using a \textbf{cost function} or a loss function.
    \item In ML, a cost function is used to represent how far away our model is from the real data.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A common way to do this is via the quadratic cost function\footnote{This is
      just the sum of the squares of the vertical distances between the points and the straight line}:\vspace{.4em}
      $J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2N}\sum^{N}_{n=1}(h_{\theta}(x^{(n)}) - y^{(n)})^{2}$.\vspace{.4em}
      \item We are interested in the parameters that minimize this quadratic cost function.
      This is called ordinary least squares (OLS).
    \end{itemize}
    \item One adjusts the mathematical model usually by varying parameters within the model, so as
    to \textit{minimize the cost function}. This is interpreted as given the best model that fits the data.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What are the risks of not splitting the data?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Overfitting or underfitting to the data
    \item Inaccurate representation of how the model will generalize
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Any caveats on training and testing?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Over many epochs, if the test error begins to rise (and it's much
    bigger than the training error) then you have overfitted.
    \item (Please refer to the Measuring success section to discuss ways in
    which we can void overfitting.)
    % \item To help avoid overfitting sometimes we divide up our original data
    % into three sets. The third data set is the validation data set.
    % (One can use cross validation to evaluate performance of model using
    % training, test, and validation data sets.)

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Model optimization outline?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item We'll discuss the bias-variance trade-off.
    \item We'll cover what we mean by bias and variance from a conceptual level.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Bias and Variance in Machine learning?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Bias\footnote{High bias is the result of the algorithm missing the
    relevant relations between features and target outputs}, in ML, is the algorithm's
    tendency to consistently learn the wrong thing by not taking into account
    all the information in the data. (results in inaccurate predictions).
    \item Variance\footnote{High variance is a result of the algorithm fitting to
    random noise in the training data} is an algorithm's sensitivity
    to small fluctuations in the training data set.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you be more specific about Bias and Variance?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{Bias} is how far away (or error) the trained model is from the correct
    result \textit{on average}. Where ``on average'' means over many goes at
    training the model, using different data:
    \begin{wideitemize}
    \item $Bias(\hat{f}(x^{'})) = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[\hat{f}(x)]}_{\text{Average error}} - \quad f(x^{'})$
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{Variance} is a measure of the magnitude of that error.
    \begin{wideitemize}
    \item $Var(\hat{f}(x^{'})) = \mathbb{E}[\hat{f}(x)^{2}] - \mathbb{E}[\hat{f}(x^{'})]^{2}$
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item There' a trade-off between bias and variance: As one is reduced,
    the other is increased\footnote{This the matter of over-and-underfitting}.

}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. How do you tune a model for optimal complexity?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item There are two methods to tune a model for optimal complexity:\medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item Hyper-parameter tuning -- choosing a set of optimal hyper-parameters
      for fitting a ML algorithm (e.g., linear regression)
      \item Regularization -- a technique used specifically to reduce overfitting
      by discouraging overly complex models in some way.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is a hyper-parameter?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item A model \textbf{parameter} is a configuration variable that
    is internal to the model and \textit{whose value can be estimated from data}.
    \item A model \textbf{hyper-parameter} is a configuration that is external
    to the model and \textit{whose value cannot estimated from data}, and
    \textit{whose value guides how the algorithm learns parameter values from
    the data}. E.g., depth of a decision tree is a model hyper-parameter vs
    ticket price or ticket class are model parameters.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is Regularization?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Regularization is a form of regression, which constrains/regularizes or shrinks
    the (learned) coefficient estimates towards zero. In other words, this technique
    reduces overfitting by discouraging learning a more complex model in some way.
  \end{wideitemize}
  \begin{framed}
    The goal of Regularization is to allow enough flexibility for the algorithm
    to learn the underlying patterns in the data but provides guardrails so it
    doesn't overfit. See Occam's razor -- whenever possible, choose the simplest
    model to a problem.
  \end{framed}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Can you provide Regularization examples?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textbf{Ridge regression and lasso regression}: adding a penalty
    to the loss function (See Model fitting slide) to constrain coefficients.
    \item \textbf{Dropout}: some nodes are ignored during training which
    forces the other nodes to take on more or less responsibility for the
    input-output.

\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is the difference between these terms?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item To find out the difference between these terms you need to know some
    of the machine learning terms like Gradient Descent to help you better
    understand.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is Gradient Descent?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Gradient descent is an \textit{iterative} optimization algorithm used to minimize
    some \textit{convex} function by \textit{iteratively} moving in the direction of
    steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.
    \item In ML, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of a ML model.\medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item Start with an initial guess for each parameter $\theta_{k}$. Then
      move $\theta_{k}$ in the \\direction of the slope.
      \item Update all $\theta_{k}$ parameters simultaneously (known as batch gradient descent),
      and \\repeat until convergence.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Unpacking Gradient Descent?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Gradient means the rate of inclination or declination of a slope.
    \item Descent means we are dealing with the inclination of a slope.
    \item The algorithm is iterative means that we need to get the results
    \textbf{multiple times} to get the most optimal result (minima of a curve).
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is Stochastic Gradient Descent?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Similar to batch gradient descent except that you only update
    using one of the data points each time.
    \item And that data point is chosen randomly. Hence the stochastic.
    \item In other words, stochastic gradient descent pick an $n$ at random
    and then update using one of the data points. Repeat, picking another
    data point at random, etc.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is an epoch?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item In some ML methods, one uses the same training data many times,
    as the algorithm gradually converges, for example, in stochastic gradient
    descent. Each time the whole training set of data is used in the training
    that is called an \textbf{epoch}\footnote{Typically you won't
    get decent results until convergence after many epochs}.
    \item One might see a decreasing error as the number of epochs increases.
    But that doesn't mean your algorithm is getting better, it could easily
    mean that you are overfitting\footnote{This could happen if the learning
    algorithm has seen the training data so many times or epochs}. To test for
    this you introduce a test data set, the data that you've held back.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. So, what is the right numbers of epochs?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Unfortunately, there is no right answer to this question. The answer
    is different for different data sets but you can say that the numbers of
    epochs is related to how diverse your data is. For example, do you have
    only black cats in your data set or is it much more diverse dataset?
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is a batch?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item As I said, you can't pass the entire data set into a ML algorithm at
    once. So, you divide data set into a number of batches or sets or parts.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is an iteration?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item An iteration is the number of batches needed to complete one epoch.
    \item Let's say we have 2000 training examples that we are going to use.
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item We can divide the dataset of 2000 examples into batches of 500
      then it will take 4 iterations to complete 1 epoch.
    \end{wideitemize}

\subsection{Fitting a basic model}
\begin{transitionsubframe}
  \begin{center}
    \Huge Run fivefold cross-validation and select the best models.
  \end{center}
\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Fit a basic model using cross validation?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Goal: To understand what the baseline performance looks like
    \footnote{We'll use only the training set}.
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item From sklearn, import RandomForestClassifier, and cross-val-score
      to compute the accuracy of the baseline model.
    \end{wideitemize}
    \item Next, we will select other models in order to beat our baseline.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Tunning Hyper-parameters?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Run grid search to find the optimal hyper-parameter settings for our models.
    \item Our goal of this step is to find the optimal model that beats that baseline performance.
    \item We use GridSearchCV\footnote{a wrapper around cross fail score that allows us to
    run grid search within cross validation.}, which yields multiple combinations of hyper-params
    values, to find the combinations that improves performance\footnote{Recall that a model is a
    configuration of the ML algorithm on specific params values}.
    % \begin{wideitemize}
    %   \item Go ahead and import this random forest classifier again, but now
    %   instead of using cross fail score, we will use \textit{GridSearchCV}, and
    %   all GridSearchCV is, is a wrapper around cross fail score, that allows us to
    %   run grid search within cross validation.
    %   \item GridSearchCV yields multiple combinations of hyper-params values and finds the
    %   combinations that improves performance\footnote{Recall that a model is a configuration
    %   of the ML algorithm on specific params values}.
    % \end{wideitemize}

\subsection{Re-fit models on full training set}
\begin{transitionsubframe}
  \begin{center}
    \Huge Re-fit models on full training set, evaluate those models
    on the validation set and pick the best one.
  \end{center}
\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}{\textbf{Q. Evaluating results on Validation set?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}\small
    \item Now that we've done some hyper parameter tuning, and we have a good idea
    of what the best hyper parameter combinations are, let's evaluate these models on
    the validation set\footnote{Now the performance shouldn't deviate too much from
    the performance we saw with the cross-validation.}.
    \item The process goes like this:
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item[1] Look at additional performance metrics beyond just accuracy
      (e.g., precision and recall) and also at different ML algorithms.
      \item[2] Take the $3$ best performing models and \textbf{re-fit} them
      using the whole training data\footnote{Why do we need to do that? Because
      these models were fit on only $80$\% of the training data; we need now the entire training data.}.
      \item[3] Evaluate these models on the validation set\footnote{This is the truth test.
      If they are overfit or underfit, then they will fail here.}.
      \item[4] Select the best performing model.
    \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Evaluate that best model}
\begin{transitionsubframe}

    \Huge Evaluate that best model on the test set to gauge its ability

\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Final model selection and evaluation on test set?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}\small
    \item Next, we'll evaluate the best model on the test set. This will give us
    a truly unbiased view of how it should preform moving forward.
    \item Why do we need to evaluate it on test data, given they have already evaluated on unseen data?
    \medskip
    \begin{wideitemize}
      \item For the validation set was created by \textbf{randomly} distributing examples from
      the full data set. So if that validation set was slightly different perhaps we would
      have chosen a different model.
      \item So by nature of this fact that testing on the validation set impacted what model
      was chosen as our final model, it's technically part of the model training process.
      \item So this final test set is purely for evaluation purposes to see that it matches
      the performance that we've seen before and to give us more confidence in the performance
      of the model moving forward.

  \begin{center}
    \Huge Regression algorithms
  \end{center}
\end{transitionsubframe}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is Regression?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item \textbf{Regression} is a statistical process for estimating
  the relationship among variables, often used to make a prediction about
  some outcome.\medskip
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item \textit{From a Machine Learning perspective, the modeling of this relationship
    is done to ensure generalization -- giving the model the ability to predict
    outputs for inputs it has never seen before.}
  \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is linear regression?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item \textbf{Linear regression} is one type of regression that is used when
  you want to predict a continuous target variable (output).\medskip
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item The essence of LR is that given some correlated data, LR tries to find
    the line that best fits the data, so that we can yield a continuous quantity output.
  \end{wideitemize}
  \item For instance, to predict the number of umbrellas sold by the amount of
  rainfall you use the algorithm definition for linear regression is $y = mx + b$,
  where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, and $b$
  and $m$ (i.e., slope) are coefficients dictating the equation\footnote{e.g., a
  model that assumes a linear relationship between the input}.\medskip
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Based on the rainfall data, you could infer the number of umbrellas sold
    for an amount of rainfall for which we don't any data.
  \end{wideitemize}
  % \item Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two continuous
  %   variables -- a scalar response (or dependent variable) and and one or more
  %   explanatory variables (or independent variables) -- by fitting a linear
  %   equation to observed data.
  % \item The governing algorithm or equation for linear regression is also quite simple.
  %   It takes the form: $y = mx + b$ where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the
  %   independent variable, and $b$ and $m$ (i.e., slope) are coefficients
  %   dictating the equation.
  % \item e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input
  %   variables $x$ and the single output variable $y$.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. How does linear regression work?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item The way Linear Regression works is by trying to find the weights (namely, $m$ and $b$)
  that lead to the best-fitting line for the input data (i.e. X features) we have.
  The best-fitting line is determined in terms of \textbf{lowest cost}.\medskip
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Generally, cost refers to the loss or error that the model yields in terms
    of \textit{how off it is from the actual Training data}.
    \item When it comes to Linear Regression, the \textbf{cost function} we usually
    use is the Squared Error Cost (i.e., Mean Square Error):
    $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_{i}-(mx_{i} + b))^2$
    \item The goal is to try to find\footnote{Using Gradient descent} the values for
    $m$ and $b$ that will give you the lowest MSE score. (Training is basically finding
    these values.) The best fitted line is the one with the lowest MSE value.
  \end{wideitemize}
  % \item Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two continuous
  %   variables -- a scalar response (or dependent variable) and and one or more
  %   explanatory variables (or independent variables) -- by fitting a linear
  %   equation to observed data.
  % \item The governing algorithm or equation for linear regression is also quite simple.
  %   It takes the form: $y = mx + b$ where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the
  %   independent variable, and $b$ and $m$ (i.e., slope) are coefficients
  %   dictating the equation.
  % \item e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input
  %   variables $x$ and the single output variable $y$.
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Side notes: Linear regression?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item Linear Regression is the process of finding a line that best fits the data
    points available on the plot, so that we can use it to predict output values for
    inputs that are not present in the data.
    \item Performance (and error rates) depends on various factors including the
    how clean and consistent the data is.
    \item In case of bad model performance, we usually go for a \textbf{higher polynomial function}.
    This is basically the introduction of new variables into the Regressor function so
    that we allow more flexibility to it\footnote{However, this will cause the LR line
    not to be a straight line anymore.}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is logistic regression?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item \textbf{Logistic regression} is a form or regression where the
  target variable is binary (zero or one, or true or false). It takes the form:
  {\Large $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(mx + b)}}$}
  \item Let's say I wanted to examine the relationship between my basketball
  shooting accuracy and the distance that I shoot from. More specifically, I want
  a model that takes in ``distance from the basket'' in feet and spits out the
  probability that I will make the shot ($1$ for a make, $0$ for a miss).
  \begin{wideitemize}\vspace{2mm}\small
    \item In this context, $-(mx + b)$, labeled as $z$, represents
    \textit{log(odds of making shot)}\footnote{odss = P(Event) / [1-P(Event)]},
    so the probability of making a shot (i.e., $y$) is $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$.
    Here, $m$ and $b$ are the coefficients we're interested in finding thru optimization,
    and $x$ is \textit{distance from basket}.
  \end{wideitemize}
  \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. Logistic regression example?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item \textbf{Shooting Baskets}. Generally, the further I get from the basket,
  the less accurately I shoot: when given a small distance, the model should predict
  a high probability and when given a large distance it should predict a low probability.
  \begin{wideitemize}\vspace{2mm}\small
    \item In logistic regression the output $Y$ is in log odds. Let's say I shot
    $100$ free throws and made $70$. Based on this sample, my probability of making
    a free throw is $70$\%. My odds of making a free throw is $2.33$, which we
    want to bound between $0$ and $1$ using \textit{log} and the \textit{sigmoid} function,
    as odds go from $0$ to $INF$\footnote{log odds are just probability stated another way}:
    \item We can write our logistic regression equation: $z = log(mx + b)$, where
    $m$ and $b$ are the coefficients to be learned.
    \item And to get probability from $z$, which is in log odds, we apply the sigmoid
    function: $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$\footnote{This shows how we can go from a linear
    estimate of log odds to a probability.} In this case, a high probability means
    I will be able to shoot and a lot probability means I won't.

    try to come up with a best fit line that makes any sense.
    \item<2-> It'll try to fit a line that fits all of the data and it will end up
    predicting negative values and values over one, which is impossible.
    \item<3-> \textbf{Logistic regression} is built off of a logistic or sigmoid curve (S shape)
    and will always be between zero and one, which makes it a better fit for a binary classification problem.

  of what's going on within the algorithm.

  values, no complex relationships} data, need a \textbf{quick} initial benchmark.

  \begin{wideitemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0.6em}
  \item[-] You have a continuous target variable.
  \item[-] You have a massive amount of data\footnote{e.g., lots of features and
  very few rows, or lots of rows and very few features}.
  \item[-] You have unwieldy\footnote{e.g., many outliers, many missing
  values, complex relationships} data, performance\footnote{will usually do pretty

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\textbf{Q. What is KMeans?}}
  \begin{wideitemize}
  \item \textbf{KMeans} is a unsupervised ML algorithm. It takes some data points
  as input and groups\footnote{grouping is the training phase of KMeans, and uses
  the square of the L2 norm as its cost function} them into $k$
  clusters\footnote{It uses the distance between points as a measure of similarity,
  based on $k$ averages (i.e. means).} (the output).\medskip
  \begin{wideitemize}
    \item This $k$ is called a hyper-parameter; a variable whose value we set before training.
    \item The idea is simple: You have a bunch of vectors. Then you take a bunch seed-guesses for the
    $k$ centers (centroid) of the clusters. You assign each vector to the nearest cluster. And then,
    when everything is done, you calculate the mean values of the clusters (updated $k$ centers).
    And then you just do it again: you re-assign the nearest mean. Then you keep on going
    until it converges\footnote{Once those centroids stop moving, the algorithm stop}.
